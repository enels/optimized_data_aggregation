Instructions on how to ingest the data into the database and run the application
================================================================================

NOTE: Make sure you have all the required software in the requirements.txt file
      installed in your container (virtual environment or docker) or host machine before attempting to run the
      application or ingest the data

After successfully downloading the application from github either directly in zip format
or through git clone, follow the steps below to sucessfully ingest and run the application

1.) Create a database called 'shopdb' in your postgresql database using the command 
    CREATE DATABASE shopdb

2.) Run the command to restore the database and its tables in your newly created database 
    psql -U postgres -f shop.sql

3.) Run this command to ingest the data in the data/ folder into the newly created database
    python ingest_data.py

4.) Run the RestAPI application with the command
    python app.py

5.) You can use either your browser, postman, or swagger or any of your favourite tool to run the created
    API endpoints to retrieve resources from the database.


Endpoints created
-----------------
Monthly sales summary: /monthly-sales-summaries
Monthly sales summary by product: /monthly-sales-summaries/product/<id>
Monthly sales summary by region: /monthly-sales-summaries/region/<id>
Monthly sales summary by date range: /monthly-sales-summaries/date-range/<startdate>/<enddate>
Top 5 ranked products based on revenue: /top-five-ranked

The product_id and region_id, startdate, and enddate are resource values from the database
The date range was designed to fall between January 2024 and December 2024

To run the unittests, run the file
python query_performance_test_module.py
